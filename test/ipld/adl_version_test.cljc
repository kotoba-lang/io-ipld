  "Declaring which version of an ADL a schema means, and refusing a reader
  that means a different one.

  An ADL name is not a layout. A reader written for one version and data
  written in another agree on the name, resolve the same capability, and
  disagree about the bytes -- so the traversal succeeds and returns values that
  are structurally real and logically wrong. Nothing downstream can tell that
  from a correct read.

  Measured 2026-09-06 before this existed: `advanced` entries had to be exactly
  `{}`, so a version could not be written down at all, and a v1 reader against
  v2 data was indistinguishable from a correct pair."
