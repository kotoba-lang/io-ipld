;; ── crossing a link into a RAW block ────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; The shape every byte-carrying DAG has: a DAG-CBOR root whose links point at
;; raw leaves. `raw-leaves` is the IPFS default, `:bytes` is a Data Model kind,
;; and there is nothing inside a raw block to explore -- so a traversal must be
;; able to reach one, include it, and stop.
;;
;; It could not. `ipld/get-verified-block` assumed dag-cbor and threw
;; `block codec is not dag-cbor` for anything else, so `ipld.graph` -- the
;; traversal core under both IPQ and the GraphSync adapter -- could only cross
;; links inside an all-dag-cbor DAG. Measured 2026-09-08 on the live
;; `ipfs.kotobase.net/ipq/v1` surface: a selector reaching a Link to a raw leaf
;; answered HTTP 500, while the same selector aimed one position left or right
;; (a string, a number) in the same vector answered 200.
