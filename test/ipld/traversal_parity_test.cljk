  "P2-4 of ADR-2608170400: fallback parity.

  Read literally the item asks that the HTTP path return the same result when
  GraphSync is absent, which is vacuous while GraphSync does not exist. The
  load-bearing version is one layer down.

  `ipld.graph` calls itself the common correctness core for a GraphSync
  adapter and a trustless HTTP/CAR gateway, but it offers two ways through it
  and they do not share code: `select-blocks` delegates to
  `selector/select-graph`, while `advance-cursor` runs its own task loop. Two
  implementations of one traversal semantics is the shape this workspace warns
  about -- the same decision in two places, one of which gets fixed. An
  adapter built on the cursor and a gateway built on select-blocks would then
  answer differently for the same selector, and nothing would say so.

  These are the assertions that would notice."
