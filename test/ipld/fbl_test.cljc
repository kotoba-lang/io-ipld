  "Reading a range out of a chunked byte object, and refusing to return a
  short one.

  The property that matters is exhaustive rather than illustrative: for a
  known sequence, EVERY `[start, end)` must equal the same slice of the
  original. A layout bug is almost never wrong for all ranges -- it is wrong
  at a chunk boundary, or for a range that starts inside one leaf and ends
  inside another, and a handful of hand-picked cases miss exactly those."
