  "Drives `resources/ipld/schema-dsl-coverage.edn` against the implementation.

  The table exists because ADR-2608170400 P1-2 asks for the upstream grammar
  correspondence with unsupported constructs enumerated, rather than a
  completeness claim taken from a test count. A table that is only prose rots
  silently, so every row here is executed: a `:round-trips` row must decode,
  and a `:rejected` row must fail with the recorded code. Adding a construct to
  the table without implementing it fails, and implementing one without
  updating the table fails too."
