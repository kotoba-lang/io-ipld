  "P2-3 of ADR-2608170400: disconnect -> checkpoint -> resume, and a cursor
  state that refuses tampering.

  A checkpoint is resumed work, and it travels -- handed to a peer, parked in
  storage, handed back. Both halves matter and they fail differently: a resume
  that returns a different result is a bug you can see, while a resume that
  returns a confident result for a graph nobody asked for is not."
