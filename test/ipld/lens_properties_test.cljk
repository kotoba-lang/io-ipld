  "P1-3 of ADR-2608170400: DMT/lens round-trip, union ambiguity, and the
  recursive depth/node budgets.

  The round-trip property is the one that matters for a lens: decoding a
  representation to its logical form and encoding it back must return the
  representation you started from. A lens that loses information passes any
  single-direction test and still corrupts data."
