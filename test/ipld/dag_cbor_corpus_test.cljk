  "Drives `resources/ipld/dag-cbor-corpus.edn`.

  P1-1 of ADR-2608170400 asks for a canonical/invalid DAG-CBOR corpus. The
  point of holding it as data is that both directions are checkable: a
  canonical row pins the exact bytes the encoder must produce *and* that
  decoding them returns the node, while an invalid row pins that a conforming
  reader refuses. Three invalid rows were accepted when this corpus was first
  measured, which is why it is here rather than in prose."
