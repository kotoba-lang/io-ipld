  "Pinned to bytes this repository did not produce.

  The advertisement below was fetched 2026-08-26 from a live third-party
  IPNI publisher (http://157.148.101.187:3105). Its served bytes hash to
  the CID it is served under, which makes those bytes the canonical form
  by definition -- so an encoder that claims to write DAG-JSON has to
  reproduce them exactly, and any disagreement is this encoder being
  wrong rather than a matter of taste.

  What that pins, which a self-consistent test could not: that map keys
  are sorted bytewise rather than kept in schema order, that byte strings
  are standard base64 without padding rather than base64url, and that
  `<`, `>` and `&` are not escaped the way Go's encoding/json escapes
  them by default."
