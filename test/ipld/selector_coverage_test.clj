  "Drives `resources/ipld/selector-coverage.edn`.

  P1-4 of ADR-2608170400 asks for the remaining selector kinds to be decided.
  Two are decided as not-adopted, and a decision that is only prose is
  indistinguishable from an oversight -- so the table is executed: implemented
  kinds must round-trip, and not-adopted kinds must be refused. If someone
  later implements one, this fails until the decision is revisited on purpose."
