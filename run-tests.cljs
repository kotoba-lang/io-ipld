  "Every `.cljc` suite in this repository, run under nbb.

   The compiled ClojureScript suite cannot expose SCI's type/protocol boundary,
   so this is a required, separate qualification target for consumers that
   execute the shared `.cljc` sources through nbb. The fleet gate
   `nbb-cross-runtime-io-ipld` runs this file at a pinned nbb version.

   It used to name three of the ten. That is not a smaller version of the same
   check -- the seven it left out were the ones the gate's own header is about
   (`ipld.link/link-cid` reading a deftype field, `(count uint8-array)`), and
   running them for the first time on 2026-08-24 found `value_test`'s -0.0
   fixture had never worked on this runtime. Anything added to `test/` as
   `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below; being required is not being run.

   The five `.clj` suites stay `.clj` on purpose (corpus, fuzz, and lens
   property tests with JVM oracles) -- split by which runtime a test can run
   on, not by subject (root ADR-2608730000).

   Run it with the sibling checkouts on the classpath:

     nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -Spath)\" run-tests.cljs"
